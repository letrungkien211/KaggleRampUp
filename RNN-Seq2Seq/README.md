1. [attention.py](https://github.com/letrungkien211/LML/blob/master/RNN-Seq2Seq/attention.py) contains all model logic.
2. [attention.main.py](https://github.com/letrungkien211/LML/blob/master/RNN-Seq2Seq/attention.main.py) runs train and test cases
3. attention.main.outputsample.txt is a sample output after executing attention.main.py
